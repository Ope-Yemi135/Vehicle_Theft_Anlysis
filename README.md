#  Vehicle Theft Analytics (2022)

**Data-Driven Crime Pattern Analysis & Risk Profiling**

---

##  Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory and descriptive analytics assessment of national vehicle theft data for 2022. The objective was to uncover temporal patterns, geographic concentration, vehicle vulnerability factors, and risk clusters to support strategic security planning and operational decision-making.

The analysis leverages percentage distribution modeling, categorical segmentation, and trend evaluation to transform raw incident data into actionable intelligence.

##  Business Problem

Vehicle theft incidents are unevenly distributed across:

- Time periods  
- Geographic regions  
- Vehicle categories  
- Model years  

Stakeholders require structured analytical insights to:

- Identify peak theft periods  
- Detect high-risk geographic clusters  
- Determine the most vulnerable vehicle categories  
- Support data-driven enforcement and prevention strategies

## 📈 Analytical Approach

### 1️⃣ Time-Series Analysis
- Monthly trend evaluation  
- Peak period identification  
- Seasonal fluctuation assessment  

### 2️⃣ Regional Distribution Analysis
- Percentage contribution by region  
- Risk concentration modeling  
- Top-performing region ranking  

### 3️⃣ Vehicle Segmentation
- Vehicle type distribution  
- Model year vulnerability profiling  
- Color frequency analysis  
- Make-based distribution patterns  

### 4️⃣ Risk Ranking (Top-N Analysis)
- Identification of highest-risk vehicle categories  
- Regional risk prioritization  
- Concentration scoring

##  Key Findings

| Metric | Insight |
|--------|----------|
| **Total Thefts** | 4,527 incidents |
| **Peak Month** | March 2022 – 1,049 incidents |
| **Highest Risk Region** | Auckland – 36% of national thefts |
| **Most Targeted Vehicle Type** | Station Wagons – 945 cases |
